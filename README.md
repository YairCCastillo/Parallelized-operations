# Parallelized-operations
The addition, subtraction, multiplication, transposition, and inversion operations of matrix algebra were implemented sequentially and in parallel to observe the time difference in C++.

This work consists of designing and coding a parallelization for the algorithms of matrix addition/subtraction, multiplication, and inverse (through Gauss-Jordan reduction). Additionally, a comparison of the results obtained from sequential and parallel algorithms tested with matrices of different sizes is presented. The functioning of both sequential and parallel algorithms is explained.
